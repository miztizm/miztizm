**Indie Solo IA Company Founder · Systems Architect · Security-Minded Builder**  
_Cyber shogun energy. Monk discipline. Shipping > talking._

Welcome to my GitHub: not a portfolio, a **workshop**.  
I build products end-to-end — code, design, infra, automation, security — and I keep them alive.

If you’re here for “motivational founder quotes,” wrong dojo.  
If you’re here for **systems that run**, **tools that ship**, and **clean execution under chaos** — welcome.

## ⚙️ Sectors / Domains I operate in

### 🧩 Product Engineering (Full-Stack)
- Web apps, dashboards, realtime UX, multi-tenant patterns
- Browser extensions, desktop tools, cross-surface UX consistency

### 🎨 Design / UX (Design Systems)
- UI/UX systems, interactive components, brand language
- “Feel” matters — speed, clarity, friction control, dopamine control

### 🛰️ Infra / DevOps
- Linux, deployment pipelines, containers, monitoring, performance tuning
- Building systems that survive updates, traffic spikes, and human error

### 🛡️ Security (Defensive, threat-aware architecture)
- Hardening, isolation, least-privilege mindset, auditing
- I design like things will be attacked — because they will

### 🤖 Automation / RPA Mindset
- Scripts, bots, pipelines, “do it once then never do it again”
- Turning repetitive ops into deterministic machines

---

## 🧠 The miztizm doctrine (no BS)
- **Ship fast, don’t ship fragile**
- **Design is not decoration — it’s control**
- **Automation is compassion for your future self**
- **Security is architecture, not a feature**
- **The real flex is maintenance**

## 🏴‍☠️ Main Projects / Worlds (live + active)

### ♾ SCHEMA — community system / social experiment OS
Decentralized-minded collective architecture: people, roles, missions, projects, economy, and governance mechanics.
- 🌐 Main: https://schema.cx  
- 🌐 Git: https://git.schema.cx  
- 🧬 Org: https://github.com/sch8ma  

> SCHEMA is a long game. Systems, culture, and tools built to outlast trends.

### 🌎 Utophi — collaborative world simulation game
A browser simulation game where players live inside a shared city-scale system: rules, scarcity, roles, social engineering.

## 🧬 Stack signals (what shows up a lot)
- TypeScript, React / Next.js
- Laravel / Livewire / Alpine
- Rust (desktop + systems mindset)
- Python, Go automation
- SQL, Docker, Linux

I pick stacks like weapons: for **reliability**, **maintainability**, and **shipping pressure** — not fashion.

---

## 🎙️ Side Quests (still serious)
- **Voiceover Artist**
- **Musician** 
- **Writer** 
- “Monk mode” discipline (training + meditation)
- Automation obsession (RPA brain)

## 🤝 Collaboration
I’m open to serious collaboration if you’re:
- building real products
- security-aware
- allergic to bullshit
- comfortable with high standards

If you want to work, bring:
- a clear goal
- constraints
- a timeline
- and honesty

## 🪪 “Founder” title — what to put?
Use what matches your vibe. Options that don’t sound like LinkedIn cosplay:

- **Indie Solo Company Founder / Systems Architect** (best if you own and ship products)
- **Builder / Architect** (minimal, strong)
- **Product Engineer** (neutral + credible)
- **Founder-Engineer** (direct, no fluff)

I’d go with: **Indie Founder / Systems Architect**.
