# miztizm 🗡️🧠  
**Indie Solo IA Company Founder · Systems Architect · Security-Minded Builder**  
_Cyberpunk operator. Biohacker curious. Shipping > speeches._

Welcome to my GitHub: not a portfolio — a **workshop**.  
I build products end-to-end (code, design, infra, automation, security) and I keep them alive in the wild.

If you’re here for motivational founder quotes, wrong dojo.  
If you’re here for **systems that run**, **tools that ship**, and **ideas forged under chaos** — welcome.

## ⚙️ Sectors / Domains I operate in

### 🧩 Product Engineering (Full-Stack)
- Web apps, dashboards, realtime UX, multi-tenant patterns  
- Browser extensions, desktop tools, cross-surface UX consistency

### 🎨 Design / UX (Design Systems)
- UI/UX systems, components, brand language  
- “Feel” matters: speed, clarity, friction control, dopamine control

### 🛰️ Infra / DevOps
- Linux, deployment pipelines, containers, monitoring, performance tuning  
- Systems that survive updates, traffic spikes, and human error

### 🛡️ Security (Defensive, threat-aware architecture)
- Hardening, isolation, least-privilege mindset, auditing  
- I design like things will be attacked — because they will

### 🤖 Automation / RPA Mindset
- Scripts, bots, pipelines, “do it once then never do it again”  
- Turning repetition into deterministic machines

---

## 🧠 The miztizm doctrine (no BS)
- **Ship fast, don’t ship fragile**
- **Design is not decoration — it’s control**
- **Automation is compassion for your future self**
- **Security is architecture, not a feature**
- **The real flex is maintenance**

---

## 🧬 Chaos vs Discipline
I’m not a perfect monk-machine. I’m closer to **cyberpunk chaos with a training routine**.

- Some weeks: pure flow state, midnight builds, war-room energy  
- Other weeks: I reset with **fasting, training, meditation, biohacking experiments**   
- I use structure when it helps, and I break structure when exploration wins

Call it **controlled madness**: enough order to ship, enough chaos to evolve.

- and honesty

## 🪪 “Founder” title — what to put?
Options that don’t sound like LinkedIn cosplay:

- **Indie Solo Founder / Systems Architect**  
- **Founder-Engineer**  
- **Builder / Architect**  
- **Product Engineer**  

I’d go with: **Indie Solo Founder / Systems Architect**.
